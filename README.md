# 💰 Employee Salary Prediction using Lasso Regression

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting **employee monthly salary** using Machine Learning techniques.
The goal is to build a robust regression model while addressing common challenges such as:

* Overfitting
* Multicollinearity
* Model complexity

To achieve this, we implemented and compared:

✅ Linear Regression (Baseline)
✅ Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)
✅ Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)

The final model was deployed as an **interactive Streamlit web application**.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Accurate salary prediction is valuable for:

* Compensation planning
* Budget forecasting
* HR analytics
* Fair pay analysis

This project uses employee attributes like experience, education, and job role to predict salary.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

### **1️⃣ Linear Regression**

Baseline model for performance comparison.

---

### **2️⃣ Ridge Regression (L2)**

Applies coefficient shrinkage to reduce model variance and handle multicollinearity.

[
Loss = RSS + \lambda \sum w^2
]

✔ Stabilizes coefficients
✔ Reduces overfitting

---

### **3️⃣ Lasso Regression (L1)**

Performs coefficient shrinkage **and feature selection**.

[
Loss = RSS + \lambda \sum |w|
]

✔ Eliminates weak predictors
✔ Improves interpretability
✔ Simplifies model

## ⚖️ Ridge vs Lasso

| Aspect                | Ridge    | Lasso   |
| --------------------- | -------- | ------- |
| Regularization        | L2       | L1      |
| Feature Selection     | ❌ No     | ✅ Yes   |
| Coefficient Shrinkage | ✅ Yes    | ✅ Yes   |
| Model Complexity      | Moderate | Simpler |

## 📊 Results Summary

| Model                | RMSE        | R² Score     |
| -------------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| Linear Regression    | 5199.74     | 0.9555       |
| Ridge Regression     | 5193.94     | 0.9556       |
| **Lasso Regression** | **5058.03** | **0.9579** ✅ |
